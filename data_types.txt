1 - List the data types of incoming events:
    event              object
    status             object
    success            object
    fails              object
    symbol             object
    currency_base      object
    currency_quote     object
    exchange           object
    type               object
    timestamp         float64
    price             float64
    bid               float64
    ask               float64
    day_volume        float64

2 - What we need : 
    We need now to extract the most importants features include : 
    "symbol",
    "currency_base",
    "currency_quote",
    "type",
    "timestamp",
    "price",
    "day_volume"

    There are the most needed for now ! 

3 - What Next ?
    For now we should to convert this incoming data events from JSON to a uniform format, for our case
    we work with AVRO, so we serialize the incoming data and by next store theme into AVRO Schema.

==> So, we will create a avro schema include all features for our case.
==> Let"s install AVRO on our developement environnement.
